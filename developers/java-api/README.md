To access it just include **dev.lone.itemsadder.api.ItemsAdder** in your code.

## Important notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's very important to listen to the [ItemsAdderLoadDataEvent ](events.md#itemsadderloaddataevent)event in order to make sure items are correctly loaded before accessing them.

ItemsAdder loading is async that's why.
