# I can't unzip the pack.zip file

{% hint style="info" %}
Try to disable this option in config.yml

```yaml
zip:
  protect-file-from-unzip__DISABLE_IF_ANY_PROBLEM: false
```

This is the option to protect the zip file from unzip. Be careful when disabling it, everyone can unzip your file if you don't protect it.
