# \[] characters

## I see \[] character after uninstalling Custom ESC addon

{% hint style="info" %}
This is useful to uninstall [Custom ESC addon](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/addon-custom-esc-menu-and-death-screen-for-itemsadder.88809/)
{% endhint %}

You have to delete this folder lang folder: `data\resource_pack\assets\minecraft\lang`

Then run `/iazip` command.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (150).png>)

## I see \[] instead of my emojis/ranks

Make sure to run /iazip and reupload the resourcepack if needed.
